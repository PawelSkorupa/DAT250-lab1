# DAT250-Lab6 Report

## Overview
Objective of assignment: obtain familiarity with messaging systems and publish/subscribe paradigm.

## Step 1: Installation
I followed the instructions for using the RabbitMQ docker image and ran the container on my local machine. I didn't encounter any issues during that process.

## Step 2: Experiments: Hello World, Work Queues, Topics
I followed all three tutorials for RabbitMQ. Here is a link to my code:
https://github.com/PawelSkorupa/RabbitMqTutorial/tree/master/src/main/java/org/example

For testing the behaviour of different messaging architectures, instead of following the approach suggested in the tutorials, I configured "run configurations"
in my IntelliJ (for example, I created a configuration that runs NewTask.java 5 times, with different arguments: "first message.", "second message..", "third message...", "fourth message....", "fifth message.....").
All of the testing results were as expected.

## Technical difficulties
I didn't encounter any technical difficulties during this exercise.
